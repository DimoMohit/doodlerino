# Doodlerino

Doodlerino is a really big (almost infinite) canvas, where users can pick a random place to draw a doodle. 
Doodles are generated from a mobile app (out of this application scope) and are stored in SVG format in a file server. This application serves as a backend to a mobile app, serving:

- Doodles in a specific canvas section, specified by two coordinates (top-left and bottom-right)
- User profiles
  - Username
  - Email
  - Social media (if any)
  - Doodles by this user
